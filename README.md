# Contacts_UI_Narvar

This is User Interfact for the Contacts REST server. 

It is a single page app which lists existing contacts and lets you add a new contact by providing Name, Email and Profession.

Please open the folder in an app like Brackets. 

Brackets offers "Live Preview" feature. Please use that to open index.htm page.

By default:
	The page will show 2 contacts. Reason: Contacts REST server populates those two contacts while starting.

To Create New Contact:
	Please enter Name, Email and Profession in the input fields and click on "Create Contact" button. 
	On first attempt: You will be asked for username and password (Please enter "user" and "password" values respectively).
  	This will create a new contact and the contacts table would have the list.
